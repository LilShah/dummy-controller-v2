# Dummy Controller

## Overview

Dummy Controller is a simple example Kubernetes controller that echoes the message written in its spec to the status.

```yaml
apiVersion: interview.com/v1alpha1
kind: Dummy
metadata:
  name: dummy1
  namespace: example
spec:
  message: "I'm just a dummy"
```

The status gets updated as such:

```yaml
status:
  specEcho: "I'm just a dummy"
```

## How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster

## Installing Kind

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) ([Installation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

After installing kind, you can start it by using `kind create cluster`

**Note:** The kubernetes context should automatically switch to using `Kind`, but make sure to check with `kubectl config current-context`.

## Test the controller

The simplest method to install the controller for testing is to clone the [dummy-controller repo](https://github.com/LilShah/dummy-controller-v2) and from within it, run the following command:

```sh
make deploy
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

Give it a few minutes to download and create the pod. You can check pod status by using:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n dummy-controller-v2-system
```

A sample Dummy CR is also provided within the repo:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/interview_v1alpha1_dummy.yaml
```

**NOTE:**: You will need [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed to run the above commands.

## Uninstall

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

Undeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```
